program_interpretable,math_function,"A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from  A to B is an object f  such that every a in A  is uniquely associated with an object f(a) in B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation.",http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Function.html
program_interpretable,program,A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program
program_interpretable,primitve_data_type,"A primitive type is a concrete type whose data consists of plain old bits. Classic examples of primitive types are integers and floating-point values. Unlike most languages, Julia lets you declare your own primitive types, rather than providing only a fixed set of built-in ones. ",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/index.html#Primitive-Types-1
program_interpretable,data_structure,"In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of datavalues, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure

program_interpretable,numeric_value,A quantitative value.,
program_interpretable,code_function,"In computer science, a function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to a return value, or throws an exception if no appropriate value can be returned.",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/manual/methods/#Methods-1
program_interpretable,code_method,"A definition of one possible behavior for a function is called a method. The ignatures of method definitions can be annotated to indicate the types of arguments in addition to their number, and more than a single method definition may be provided. When a function is applied to a particular tuple of arguments, the most specific method applicable to those arguments is applied. Thus, the overall behavior of a function is a patchwork of the behaviors of its various method definitions. If the patchwork is well designed, even though the implementations of the methods may be quite different, the outward behavior of the function will appear seamless and consistent.",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/manual/methods/#Methods-1

program_interpretable,return_value,"The value returned by a function is the value of the last expression evaluated, which, by default, is the last expression in the body of the function definition.",
program_interpretable,return_tuple,"The tuple of value(s) returned by a function are the value(s) of the last expression evaluated, which, by default, is the last expression in the body of the function definition. In Julia, one returns a tuple of values to simulate returning multiple values. ",https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/
domain_interpretable ,unit,"A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity.[1] Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement

domain_interpretable ,independent_variable,"A variable manipulated by an experimenter is called an independent variable. Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a ""predictor variable"", regressor, covariate, ""controlled variable"", ""manipulated variable"", ""explanatory variable"", exposure variable (see reliability theory), ""risk factor"" (see medical statistics), ""feature"" (in machine learning and pattern recognition) or ""input variable.""] In econometrics, the term ""control variable"" is usually used instead of ""covariate"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables
domain_interpretable ,dependent_variable,"The variable(s) that represent the output or outcome whose variation is being studied. Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a ""response variable"", ""regressand"", ""criterion"", ""predicted variable"", ""measured variable"", ""explained variable"", ""experimental variable"", ""responding variable"", ""outcome variable"", ""output variable"" or ""label"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model
domain_interpretable ,concept,"A scientific or mathematical idea, mental representation, abstract object, etc. Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed ""superordinate"" and lower levels termed ""subordinate"". Additionally, there is the ""basic"" or ""middle"" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept
julia_intermediate,Expr,"A Julia type that represents an expression object.
