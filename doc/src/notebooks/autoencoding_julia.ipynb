These representations can be potentially very powerful tools for automated program analysis and curation, especially across heterogeneous research fields and repositories. \n",

    "From this brief initial analysis, we can conclude a few things. First, as with other major programming languages previously tested, deep neural networks can in fact learn to recognize Julia code structures and content in potentially useful ways. Second, we confirm that UMAP clusters in our latent space successfully capture important characteristics of the code. And third - contrary to some of our prior expectations - while the latent representations of Julia source code capture important information and patterns in Julia expressions, these do not consistently point back to particular source code packages or groups in the Julia language ontology. Instead, these representations capture more low-level differencies and similarities, finding similar code structures that more often than not repeat across different regions of the code base. As with its human creators, there is much more difference within Julia source code groups than between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these findings, it would be interesting to compare similar efforts with other languages to analyze how true this is across languages, or whether it is significantly more true in some languages than others. For instance, it would be interesting to explore if more parsimonious languages like Julia (or high level languages generally) exhibit the kind of wide disparity in syntactic patterns even within semantically similar code groups that we have seen here, while lower languages would see more syntactic similarity and semantic diversity. With respect to Julia code in particular and meta-modeling generally, we expect that further effort will enable us to leverage these embeddings for higher level tasks like recommending modifications, synthesizing models, identifying similar models, and validating the correctness of synthesized models."
